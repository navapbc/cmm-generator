# cmm-generator

This tool fetches data from AirTable and generates a nicely-formatted Capability Maturity Model document suitable for copying or importing into MS Word or Google Docs. At the moment this tool is exclusively for the WIC MIS project, but the future is bright and holds endless possibilities.

To use, clone this repo to your machine, paste your AirTable API key into ```auth.js```, and open ```index.html``` in the browser of your choice.

Or, just visit the github pages deployment and paste your API key there.
